            This paper talks about how do collaborative filtering recommender systems work, in particular it starts
            telling the reader some examples of this type of recommender systems so the reader can start to get involve
            and recognize of what type of systems they are talking. Further in the paper it talks about
            how the users get involved with the systems and which are there duties when it comes to collaborative
            filtering. Afterwards it talks about the purpose or tasks that recommender systems try to acheive, for this
            it starts explaining the different types of algorithms depending on user or items and how they can be
            improved. For every algorithm also states the various practical problems that each one of them have.
            Finally it presents for the reader the different ways that you can evaluate a recommender system of this
            class, and afterwards the major tradeoffs you need to deal when developing this systems.

            Personally I really liked how to the paper is structured because at first you get to understand the various
            algorithms and how do they works, so afterwards you are able to understand in a better way their limitations
            and because of that how important is to make a mixture of different recommender systems. Also something I
            really enjoyed is the part where it talks about how much information are the people willing to give in order
            to receive the best predictions, mostly because this is something people are talking about a lot given the
            global environment on this issue. I found really interesting that they have a section where they propose open
            questions so the reader is able to think and even question some things the authors propose.

            As I have already stated I really like this paper therefore I founded challenging in some parts, and because
            of that I had to lookup for extra information when reading it. I also think that I would like more information
            on novelty and how it can improve your recommender system. But in general is a paper I really enjoyed and learned
            a lot from it.
